# Lupyd Group Server
Meant to become Lupyd Group Protocol compatible and to set an example to be used in Lupyd and Self Hosted Environments


# Notes Learned:

Client Create Group
Makes Server Observe the Group
Any Member can creates proposals
Any one member can commit pending proposals (must be synchroinzed by server (external client))
keep track of downloaded messages, so only new messages can downloaded from server by each client
